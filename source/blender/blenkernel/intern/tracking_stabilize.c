 * Similar to the #translation_contribution, the rotation contribution is comprised of the contribution
 * by this individual track, and the averaged contribution from anchor_frame to the ref point of this track.
 * - contribution is in terms of angles, -pi < angle < +pi, and all averaging happens in this domain
 * - yet the actual measurement happens as vector between center of frame and the tracking point
 * - moreover, the frame center has to be compensated for the already determined shift offset,
 *   in order to get the pure rotation around the image center. To turn this into a \e contribution,
 *   the likewise corrected angle at the reference frame has to be subtracted, to get only the pure
 *   angle difference this tracking point has captured.
 * - to get from vectors to angles, we have to go through an arcus tangens, which involves the issue
 *   of the definition range: the resulting angles will flip by 360deg when the measured vector passes
 *   from the 2nd to the third quadrant, thus messing up the average calculation. Since \e any tracking
 *   point might be used, these problems are quite common in practice.
 * - thus we perform the subtraction of the reference and the addition of the baseline contribution
 *   in polar coordinates as simple addition of angles; since these parts are fixed, we can bake
 *   them into a rotation matrix. With this approach, the border of the arcus tangens definition range
 *   will be reached only, when the \e whole contribution approaches +- 180deg, meaning we've already
 *   tilted the frame upside down. This situation is way less common and can be tolerated.
 * - when activated, also changes in image scale relative to the rotation center can be picked up.
 *   To handle those values in the same framework, we average the scales as logarithms.
 *  @param aspect total aspect ratio of the undistorted image (includes fame and pixel aspect)

/**
 * Setup the constant part of this track's contribution to the determined frame movement.
 * Tracks usually don't provide tracking data for every frame. Thus, for determining data
 * at a given frame, we split up the contribution into a part covered by actual measurements
 * on this track, and the initial gap between this track's reference frame and the global
 * anchor_frame. The (missing) data for the gap can be substituted by the average offset
 * observed by the other tracks covering the gap. This approximation doesn't introduce
 * wrong data, but it records data with incorrect weight. A totally correct solution
 * would require us to average the contribution per frame, and then integrate stepwise
 * over all frames -- which of course would be way more expensive, especially for longer
 * clips. To the contrary, our solution cumulates the total contribution per track and
 * averages afterwards over all tracks; it can thus be calculated just based on the
 * data of a single frame, plus the "baseline" for the reference frame, which we're
 * computing here.
 *
 * Since we're averaging \e contributions, we have to calculate the \e difference of
 * the measured position at current frame and the position at the reference frame.
 * But the "reference" part of this difference is constant and can thus be packed
 * together with the baseline contribution into a single precomputed vector per track.
 *
 * In case of the rotation contribution, the principle is the same, but we have to
 * compensate for the already determined translation, because each rotation contribution
 * needs to be measured relative to the \e current image center, otherwise the rotation
 * performed for stabilization would not cancel out the measured rotation precisely.
 * To circumvent problems with the definition range of the arcus tangens function,
 * we perform this baseline addition and reference angle subtraction in polar
 * coordinates and bake this operation into a precomputed rotation matrix.
 *
 * @param track to initialize
 * @param reference_frame local for this track, the closest pick to the global anchor_frame
 * @param aspect total aspect ratio of the undistorted image (includes fame and pixel aspect)
 * @param average_translation value observed by the \e other tracks for the gap between
 *                            reference_frame and anchor_frame. This average must not contain
 *                            contributions of not yet initialized frames
 * @param average_scale_step image scale factor observed on average by the other tracks
 *                            for this frame. This value is recorded and averaged as logarithm.
 *                            The recorded scale changes are damped for very small contributions,
