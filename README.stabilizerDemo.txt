Blender 2D-Stabilizer :: Rework

The `stabilizerDemo.blen` has been used to develop and Test the reworked Stabilizer.
This file provides several work situations in a clean way; it demonstrates what the
Stabilzer version in this branch can achieve, and what he can not.

How to use the demo
-------------------

1) open the "Default" view (3D View). This simple animated scene will be our test footage.
   Render the 300 animation frames to the preconfigured path (//stab/testfame-####.png)

2) swich to the "Motion Tracking" screen. Be sure not to erase the tracking data that
   is already there. Just load the rendered test frame.

3) play with the settings in the "Stabilize 2D" pane....



NOTE: Autoscalle looks as if it is broken. It is not -- just the movement of this
demo clip is so extreme as to render autoscale useless
